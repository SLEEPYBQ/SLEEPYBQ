## Hi there 👋

I am currently an undergraduate at AI&XR Lab, Shandong University (SDU), I'll join HKUST as a PhD student in 2025 Fall.

My research mainly focuses on Human-computer Interaction, Human-centered AI, NLP and Pattern recognition. To be specific, I am researching human-centered computing, aiming to better understand humans through the analysis of human-generated data.
