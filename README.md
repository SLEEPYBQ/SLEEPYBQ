## Hi there 👋

I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Professor [Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/). 

My research mainly focuses on Human-computer Interaction, Human-centered AI, NLP and Pattern recognition. To be specific, I am researching human-centered computing, aiming to better understand humans through the analysis of human-generated data.
